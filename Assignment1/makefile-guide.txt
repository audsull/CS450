If you prefer to work directly on the command line, this guide will give you a
few simple steps to get started.  Note that the Mac example code has not been
tested for Linux, but should require only minimal changes.  See the 
"linux-notes.txt" file for more information.

1. First, unzip the example project somewhere convenient.  For the sake of
   the example we'll use ~/workspace

2. Using your favorite terminal emulator, change the directory to the project
   you just unzipped:

   `cd ~/workspace/Mac-OpenGL-Example`

3. Look through the files.  The headers from the textbook code have been
   separated out for you.

4. Enter the "SimpleProgram" directory.

   `cd SimpleProgram`

5. Try the Makefile.  In addition to compiling, we have also provided a simple
   makefile target for removing build files.

   `make`
   `make clean`

6. Try running the executable.  By default, the makefile produces an executable
   named "prog".

   `./prog`

7. Go on and explore.  The Makefile we've provided is rather simple, so don't
   hesitate to change it and add to it.
